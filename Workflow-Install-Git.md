# Install Git

To work with the ZFS software on Github, it's necessary to install the Git software on your computer and set it up.  This page covers that process for some common Linux operating systems.  Other Linux operating systems should be similar.

## Install the Software Package

The first step is to actually install the Git software package.  This package can be found in the repositories used by most Linux distributions.  If your distribution isn't listed here, or you'd like to install from source, please have a look in the [official Git documentation][git-install-linux].

### Red Hat and CentOS

```
# yum install git
```

### Fedora

```
$ sudo dnf install git
```

### Debian and Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt install git
```

## Configuring Git

Your user name and email address must be set within Git before you can make commits to the ZFS project.  In addition, your preferred text editor should be set to whatever you would like to use.

```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
```
