This experimental guide has been made official at [[Debian Buster Root on ZFS]].

If you have an existing system installed from the experimental guide, adjust your sources:

    vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list
    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib
    
    vi /etc/apt/preferences.d/90_zfs
    Package: libnvpair1linux libuutil1linux libzfs2linux libzpool2linux zfs-dkms zfs-initramfs zfs-test zfsutils-linux zfs-zed
    Pin: release n=buster-backports
    Pin-Priority: 990

This will allow you to upgrade from the locally-built packages to the official buster-backports packages.

You should set a root password before upgrading:

    passwd

Apply updates:

    apt update
    apt dist-upgrade

Reboot:

    reboot

If the bpool fails to import, then enter the rescue shell (which requires a root password) and run:

    zpool import -f bpool
    zpool export bpool
    reboot
