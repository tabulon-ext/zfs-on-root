# Commit Often

When writing complex code, it is strongly suggested that developers save their changes, and commit those changes to their local repository, on a frequent basis.  In general, this means every hour or two, or when a specific milestone is hit in the development.  This allows you to easily *checkpoint* your work.

Details of this process can be found in the [Commit the changes][W-commit] page.

In addition, it is suggested that the changes be pushed to your forked Github repository with the `git push` command at least every day, as a backup.  Changes should also be pushed prior to running a test, in case your system crashes.  This project works with kernel software.  A crash while testing development software could easily cause loss of data.

For developers who want to keep their development branches clean, it might be useful to [*squash*][W-squash] commits from time to time, even before you're ready to [create a PR][W-create-PR].
