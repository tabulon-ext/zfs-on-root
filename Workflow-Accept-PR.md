# Accept a PR

After a PR is generated, it is available to be commented upon by project members.  They may request additional changes, please work with them.

In addition, project members may accept PRs; this is not an automatic process.  By convention, PRs aren't accepted for at least a day, to allow all members a chance to comment.

After a PR has been accepted, it is available to be merged.
