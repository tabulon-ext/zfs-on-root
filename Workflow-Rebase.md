# Rebase the Update

Updates to the ZFS on Linux project should always be based on the current *master* branch.  This makes them easier to merge into the repository.

There are two steps in the rebase process.  The first step is to update the *local master* branch from the *upstream master* repository.  This can be done by entering the following commands:

```
$ git fetch upstream master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
```

The second step is to perform the actual rebase of the updates.  This is done by entering the command `git rebase upstream/master`.  If there are any conflicts between the updates in your *local* branch and the updates in the *upstream master* branch, you will be informed of them, and allowed to correct them (see the [Conflicts][W-conflicts] page).

This would also be a good time to [*squash*][W-squash] your commits.
